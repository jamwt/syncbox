//! # Futures & Streams
//!
//! Contains Future and Stream types as well as functions to operate on them.
//!
//! ## Future
//!
//! A future represents a value that will be provided sometime in the future.
//! The value may be computed concurrently in another thread or may be provided
//! upon completion of an asynchronous callback. The abstraction allows
//! describing computations to perform on the value once it is realized as well
//! as how to handle errors.
//!
//! One way to think of a Future is as a Result where the value is
//! asynchronously computed.
//!
//! # Stream
